**Induction balance metal detector**

This project is an Induction Balance Metal Detector built around Arduino Uno and a 2-line LCD display module driven by I2C.  A piezo buzzer is used to drive an earphone for audio feedback.

The search coil comprises two D-shaped coils fastened on opposite side of a 230mm diameter plastic plate.  The coils are overlapped in the middle to null or minimize the amount of voltage and current induced into the receiver coil when no metal is present.  Position of the overlap is extremely critical, to tune the lowest voltage to an absolute minimum - at which point the Calibration routine can be run.

The form on which the coils are mounted was 3D printed from "DD Coil modifiable by Gabryxx on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5966085".  The original coil was enlarged to 105% to fit the approx 16-cm coils which had already been wound.  In the end, the coil overlap is about 2.5 cm wide and 18 cm long.

The schematic for the detector was taken from Mirko Pavleski's project https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/diy-sensitive-arduino-ib-metal-detector-with-discrimination-b55e9d, modified to replace the LCD display with one I had on hand.  The dc24 project contains KiCad schematics, Mirko's project did not (only a JPG of the circuit).   The circuit was built up on a perfboard and does not seem to suffer from interference, however take care to use grounded shielded wire pairs running from the perfboard to the coils. Leave the shield grounds at the coil end unconnected.

After learning from the comments in Mirko's YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkSPy0BPTFc&t=5s "DIY sensitive Arduino Induction Balance Metal Detector with Discrimination (15cm to 50 + cm)" came from David Crocker's github project https://github.com/dc42/arduino, it was decided to use his code rather than Mirko's.

The tuning capacitors across the coils should be adjusted such that the LC networks resonate exactly at the frequency generated by the Timer0 PWM output. An oscilloscope is critical to help understand the circuit and the code behaviour, and to tune the coil resonances and phase detection.  The tuning capacitors should be metallised foil types because stable, accurate values are needed. The other capacitors can be ceramic.

The code contains a lot of notes about the discovery process, tuning the coils, understanding how the code works, fixing some issues in the code, and extending it to my liking.

Recently wrapped the non-overlapping part of each coil in grounded aluminium foil (with a gap across that part of the coil that overlaps the other coil).  The coils still can be adjusted to balance.  I didn't notice any change in sensitivity during bench testing.
